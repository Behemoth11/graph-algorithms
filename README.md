# [Graph Algorithm Visualization](https://graph.komlankodoh.com/editor/depth-first-search) 📊

This project aims to provide a visualization tool for graph algorithms. It offers an interactive environment to visualize the workings of various graph algorithms such as Breadth First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and more; View and display algorithms at https://graph.komlankodoh.com/editor

## Supported Algorithms 🛠️

- [x] Depth First Search
- [x] Breath First Search
- [x] Dijkstra Algorithm
- [x] Minimum Node Coloring 
- [x] Maximum independent set
- [x] Vertex Eccentricity
- [ ] Louvain method for community detection

## Features 🚀

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch as the algorithms traverse through the graph in real-time, with each step visualized for easy understanding.
- **Custom Graph Input**: Users can input their custom graphs to observe the algorithms' behavior on different types of graphs.
- **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Each step of the algorithm is explained, helping users understand the logic behind the algorithm's operation.
